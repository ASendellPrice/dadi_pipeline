# dadi_pipeline

Performing demographic model comparisons for either two or three population scenarios.

These workflows are designed to work with the Python package dadi (https://bitbucket.org/gutenkunstlab/dadi) 
and assumes you already have the package installed. You'll need to be familiar with how dadi works, 
and some of the basic syntax for writing your own dadi scripts. A good resource for all dadi-related 
questions is the user group: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dadi-user. Before attempting
to use these scripts, read over the user manual for dadi and try running the program with the 
example files.

If you decide to use these scripts or modify the code for your purposes, please cite:
